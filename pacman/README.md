This is a pacman game done by Dima AbdelJaber. A lot of the codes i used from the given code from Professor Freudenthal. I did get a lot of help from Jesus Ramos and Adrian Gomez. The Makefile I got help from Jesus Garcia. 
This program is a pacman and is ran on a msp430.
In this game 4 buttons work to play and move the pacman. You are supposed to use them to collect all of the dots and avoid all of the enemies and obsticles. 
You must collect all the Dots in the game to be able to win. You lose when the enemies collide with pacman. The enemies are pink squares and the dots are either orange or red
The enemies in this game are the red sliding disks

You can't go through any of the sky blue obsticles that are in the game.

first button goes up, second button goes down, third button goes left and the fourth button goes right

Files are:
pacman.c (which has the main), buzzer.c, buzzer.h, sound.c, sound.h, movingLayer.c, movingLayer.h, enemy.c, enemy.h, and the Makefile
